# PolarCode
Reimplementation of polar code - a linear block error-correcting code

This is a course work of [*Information Theory Fall 2016*](http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~ihwang/Teaching/Fa16/IT.html) instructed by Dr. I-Hsiang Wang

## Description

> Channel polarization can construct code sequences that acheve the symmetric capacity of any given binary-input discrete memoryless channel (B-DMC). 

This matlab code implemented the method described in https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.3917 .
